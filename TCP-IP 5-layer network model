Protocol: is a define set of standards that computers must follow in order to communicate properly.

Computer networking: defines the full scope of how computers communicate with each other.

TCP/IP Five-Layer Network model
No. | Layer Name | Protocol | Protocol Data Unit | Addressing
5 | Application | HTTP, SMTP, etc | Messages | na
4 | Transport | TCP/UDP | Segment | Port #s
3 | Network | IP | Datagram | IP address
2 | Data Link | Ethernet, Wi-Fi | Frames | MAC Address
1 | Physical | 10 Base T, 802.11 | Bits | na

Transport layer: sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data.

Network layer: allows a collection of networks/nodes to communicate with each other through routers. Ie, the internet is a collection of networks connected together through routers. IP = internet protocol. Client application initiates a request for data. Server software answers the request across the network.

Data link layer: is responsible for defining a common way of interpreting these signals so network devices can communicate (across a single link).
The ethernet standards also define a protocol responsible for getting data to nodes on the same network or link.

Physical layer: represents the physical devicess that interconnect computers ie cables, connectors, specifications for networking cables, sending signals.
