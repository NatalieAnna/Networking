Protocol: is a define set of standards that computers must follow in order to communicate properly.

Computer networking: defines the full scope of how computers communicate with each other.

TCP/IP Five-Layer Network model
No. | Layer Name | Protocol | Protocol Data Unit | Addressing
5 | Application | HTTP, SMTP, etc | Messages | na
4 | Transport | TCP/UDP | Segment | Port #s
3 | Network | IP | Datagram | IP address
2 | Data Link | Ethernet, Wi-Fi | Frames | MAC Address
1 | Physical | 10 Base T, 802.11 | Bits | na

Application layer: these protocols allow you to send email, browse the web, etc.

Transport layer: sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data ie ensures that the data gets to the right applications (email, browser, etc) running on those nodes. TCP = Transmission Control Protocol (has mechanisms to ensure that data is reliably delivered). UDP = User Datagram Protocol (does not have said reliability mechanismsm).

Network layer: allows a collection of networks/nodes to communicate with each other through routers. Ie, the internet is a collection of networks connected together through routers. IP = internet protocol. Client application initiates a request for data. Server software answers the request across the network.

Data link layer: is responsible for defining a common way of interpreting these signals so network devices can communicate (across a single link).
The ethernet standards also define a protocol responsible for getting data to nodes on the same network or link.

Physical layer: represents the physical devicess that interconnect computers ie cables, connectors, specifications for networking cables, sending signals.
